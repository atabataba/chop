          <p>
            Chop and Carry Farm is an emerging Soto Zen practice community on the big island of Hawai‘i.
            Inspired by the early days of Tassajara, we are working to create a place of simple living,
            meditation, and study where daily work is itself the vehicle of Buddhist practice.

        <article class="about-item">
          <h3 class="about-kicker">SUSTAINABILITY</h3>
          <p>
            Our intention is to live within what the land can sustain. That means relying on solar and wind,
            not fossil fuels; eating what can be grown; and making what can be crafted on the island. The goal
            is not only to avoid harm but to nourish the land and become its steward. In this way, sustainability
            is inseparable from Buddhist training.

          <h3 class="about-kicker">RESIDENCY</h3>
          <p>
            We are developing a residency program for no more than eight people. Life here combines meditation,
            communal work, and study with time for personal projects in farming or craft. Residents live simply,
            share in the rhythms of the land, and take part in shaping the community as it grows.

          <h3 class="about-kicker">TEACHINGS</h3>
          <p>
            Practice at Chop and Carry Farm is grounded in the teachings of Shunryu Suzuki Roshi and Dōgen Zenji,
            with a strong emphasis on farm and craft. Zen here is physical and hands-on, where everyday tasks such
            as growing food, cooking, or building are themselves forms of study. Over time, we hope to offer
            workshops, public practice opportunities, and ways for visitors to learn with us.
